                This case study investigated the usability of the Autism Camp Australia (ACA) website. The user perspective taken was from the position of parents with children diagnosed as autistic, wishing to find information on and enroll in a camp or donate to ACA. User testing was performed and assessed, with issues identified as being navigation, readibility and lack of call to action. The home, camps, enrollment and donation pages were redesigned and a prototype created.

The brief was a redesign of any modality for a cause we were passionate about. A brainstorming session followed which led to the group decision to focus on disability causes, specifically Autism Camp Australia. This decision was made on the basis that we felt the ACA website was in the most need of our support for redesigning.

          ACA provides a holiday service to families of children autism. With their intension is to improve the health and wellbeing of autistic young people and their families. This occurs through the provision of accessible and supported respite-break experiences, therapies and life skills development.
          <p class="body-para |  fs-body ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">However, the User Research found the current website design is difficult to navigate. There is no clear flow through information, with large amounts of text and no clear call to action for enrolments or donations.

  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">Our first step to gain an understanding of the user of the ACA website was to create a Proto Persona. This helped us to develop a picture of the demographics for who the perceived user of the ACA website might be, and what problems they might be experiencing in using the website. This was followed by an assessment of the current website. The most likely user flows taken by the user in navigating their way to the camps information through to enrolment, and the donation process. A heuristics assessment was also conducted to identify potential areas for improvement and WCAG colour accessibility testing performed.</p>
 <div class="content-margin">
  <h3 class="ff-primary fs-brand fw-bold  padding-block-para ">Heuristics assessment</h3>
  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular  padding-block-para">The huristics assessment was conducted by taking screen shots of the potential user flow, and adding labels in miro where we perceived there were problems.

  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular  padding-block-para">Building on the initial ideas of the potential user and how they might perceive the website, a user research plan for testing the website was created. This plan was then implemented to conduct user testing, and feedback was gained on the interface from the perspective of a real user. Aspects for investigation included: navigation of the website, heuristics, and any pain points the user identified. . These parameters were also assessed against ACA’s competitors as a competitor analysis.</p>

      <li class="ff-primary">- Identify pain points the user encounters and learn what features work well and what can be improved on.

      <h5 class="fw-bold ff-primary  padding-block-para">Methodology: </h5>
      <p class="ff-primary">User testing was conducted to collect qualitative data from 5 participants. The testing was recorded via zoom and notes taken for further data analysis. Participants were provided with 3 tasks to complete and assessed for how quickly they can identify the intuitive signaling, move through the user flow, and ask for their opinion on the aesthetics and design of the website.

<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Information Architecture</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">One of the key needs for the redesign of the ACA website was the establishment of a new primary navigational structure. Card sorting was utilized as the method to establish new groupings, labels and structure. 
  The final results were then further developed into a new sight map for the ACA website.
  Below demonstrates the original ACA navigation, and the new simplified site map for the prototype.</p>

<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To approach the problem of how we might redesign the pages in our user flow, we each set about creating wireframes. We then collaboratively identified the best solutions to be used and combined them into our low fidelity wireframes.</p>

<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">The result of our combined ideas into one set of wireframes is shown below. Key changes from the original website included, implementing the new information architecture, reducing the amount of text on the homepage, and adding links to the camps pages from the homepage. For the camps pages we adding a side navigation bar to guide the user through all the information related to the camps, a separate page for the enrolment information, with clear call to action for the enrolment form. A clear call to action was added to the homepage for donations, and donation pages created, that were branded and internal to the website.</p>

<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">Testing our design allowed us to investigate the effectiveness of our ideation phase and our solution.

</div>
<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">User Testing</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To test the effectiveness of our redesign user testing was performed. The key takeaways were, the camps pages were still lengthy, especially if the user wanted to focus on a specific piece of information. The user still felt overwhelmed with the amount of information to get through. Also, feedback received was that the links in the side navigation needed to be made to look more like links, rather than just a list. For the enrolment page, whilst logical that the information should end with the enrolment form, the user still had to go searching for it on a return visit if they didn’t remember it was at the very end of the page.</p>

<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">Even though testing showed there were still some problems with our design, we were confident that we were on the right track with our initial wireframes. To improve the prototype some iterations would be required to refine the experience for the user.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Iterations</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To solve the problems we identified in the user testing we made several iterations to the wireframes. For the camps pages the information that wasn’t currently being viewed was hidden. This was to focus the user on the selected information and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by the amount of content. Additionally, the styling for the side navigation was added to make it clearer to the user that they were links.


  <p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">On the enrolment page the same method of hiding the information not being currently viewed was used, as well as moving the links for the enrolment form to the side navigation. This was so the user was easily able to identify where the enrolment form was at any time viewing the enrolment page.</p>

<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Style Guide and High Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">With our wireframes finalised a style guide was created and applied to create the High fidelity wireframes and prototyping completed. Rebranding was not part of this redesign. However, a slight change was made to the primary blue to pass WCAG accessibility.

      <h3 class="fs-hero-subheading fw-regular ">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">The redesign of the homepage with now three routes to the Camps pages, and improving the user flow through to the enrolment form was a success. The user could clearly navigate to the camps page for the desired state, select what information to read was important to them, and easily identify how to enroll. Also, easily identify how to donate to ACA, and give the user confidence that they were actually donating to ACA, with the addition of the ACA branding to the donation pages.
  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">What I learned from the experience was that whilst a website needs to convey a lot of information to the user, it is important the way the information is presented. Large blocks of information can easily overwhelm the user. Breaking the information up into manageable sizes, showing the user there is a linear flow through the information, giving the option to skip parts, and showing there is an end in sight really helps with retaining the users interest . Additionally, making the call to action obvious to the user at all times makes the user more likely to take action at the first moment a decision is made.
