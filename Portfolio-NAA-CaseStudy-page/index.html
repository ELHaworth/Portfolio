This case study investigated the usability of the National Archives of Australia (NAA) website. The user perspective taken was from an immigrant to Australia, searching for their arrival date in Australia. User testing was performed and assessed, with issues identified as being navigation, language, readability and colour accessibility. The homepage was redesigned for desktop and mobile, and prototypes created.

The NAA is the primary location for people who immigrated to Australia before 1973 to find their immigration date. This information is critical for filling in forms for some Government agencies.

  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">My first step to gain an understanding of the user of the NAA website was to create a Proto Persona. This helped me to develop a picture of the demographics for who the perceived user of the NAA website might be, and what problems they might be experiencing in using the website. This was followed by an assessment of the current website. The most likely user flows taken by the user in navigating their way to the immigration section of the website was identified. A heuristics assessment was also conducted to identify potential areas for improvement and WCAG colour accessibility testing performed.</p>
 <div class="content-margin">
  <h3 class="ff-primary fs-brand fw-bold  padding-block-para ">Huristics assessment</h3>
  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular  padding-block-para">The heuristics assessment was conducted by taking screenshots of the potential user flow and redline annotating. Additionally, a heuristics evaluation was conducted rating aspects of the website out of 3. These aspects include: appearance, content, navigation and efficiency. The results of the assessment and a sample image of the homepage are included below.</p>

  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular  padding-block-para">Building on the initial ideas of the potential user and how they might perceive the website, a user research plan for testing the website was created. This plan was then implemented to conduct user testing, and feedback was gained on the interface from the perspective of a real user.

  <ul class="fw-bold ff-primary  padding-block-para">Objectives:</ul>

      <h5 class="fw-bold ff-primary  padding-block-para">Methodology: </h5>
      <p class="ff-primary">User testing was conducted to collect qualitative data from 5 participants. The testing was recorded via zoom and notes for further data analysis were taken. Participants were provided with 4 tasks to complete, and assessed for how quickly they could identify the intuitive signaling, move through the user flow, and asked for their opinion on the aesthetics and design of the website.

<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Desktop Five-second usability test</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To test the usability of the prototype the Five-second usability test was utilized. The test centered around the issue identified in previous testing regarding, the ability of the user to identify and navigate to the online searchable content of the website.
</p>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">Objective: The purpose of this testing was to determine if the new primary navigation groupings made it easier for the user to determine where to access the online RecordsSearch of the NAA website.
</p>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">Results: The user went straight to the primary navigation menu option, “Immigration and War Online Records”, and found the “Online Records Search” button immediately.
</p>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">Conclusion: The new primary navigation label led the user directly to the online RecordsSearch, therefore no further iteration of the navigation is required.

<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Mobile Navigation Testing</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">During the prototype process, the navigation system for the mobile version needed to be slightly different to the desktop homepage. To verify the functionality of the design user testing was performed.
</p>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">Objective: </p>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To test the functionality of the header and footer navigation on the mobile homepage.</p>
  <p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin"> To test how intuitive it is to identify and navigate to pages from the primary and footer navigation.</p>
    <p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin"> Identify pain points the user encounters throughout the navigation process.</p>
  
</p>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">Methodology:</p>

<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">User testing was conducted to collect qualitative data from 5 participants using the mobile website on the computer. The testing was recorded via zoom and notes were taken for further data analysis. Participates were provided with 2 tasks to complete. They were asked to assess how intuitive they felt the system was to use, and their ability to identify from the primary navigation where to find specific information in the secondary navigation. The participants were then asked the System Usability Scale questions and answers recorded.

<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">Even though testing showed there were still some problems with my design, I was confident that I was on the right track with my initial wireframe. To improve the prototype some iterations would be required to refine the experience for the user.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Iterations</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To solve the problems I identified in the user testing I made several iterations to the wireframe. As identified in the user testing, moving the word “online” to the second line made more sense and looked better aesthetically.


  <p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">The footer navigation change was more challenging to solve. After further consultation with the user, the longer but more specific naming proved to be easier to interpret by the user.

<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Style Guide and High Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">With my wireframes finalised a style guide was created and applied to create the high fidelity wireframes and prototype. Below is the style tile with the higher level components of the style guide. Rebranding was not part of this redesign. However, a slight change was made to the primary blue to pass WCAG accessibility.

      <h3 class="fs-hero-subheading fw-regular ">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">The redesign of the information architecture and homepage proved to successfully improve the navigation experience of the user. The use of more direct language in the navigation bar also made it easier for the user to identify what might be in the secondary navigation. 
  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">What I learned from the experience was that whilst a website may initially look impressive, some of these impressive elements can actually be confusing to the user. This can result in a bad user experience, because the user can not understand how to interact with the design. Additionally, in some cases more navigation options with specific labels can be easier to navigate for the user, rather than fewer vague options trying to cover too many categories.

      <p class="body-para | padding-block-400 fs-body ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-200">
        Further redesign opportunities were identified during the Usability Testing stage of this Case study. However, these were beyond the capability of the timeframe to be implemented.
        </p>
        <ul class="ff-primary padding-block-400 content-margin">These areas to be addressed in the future include:
        </ul> 
        <li class="ff-primary content-margin">- Simplification of the language used, or addition of better explanation of terms in the content on the secondary pages

        </li>
        <li class="ff-primary content-margin">- Reassessing the hierarchy of all pages. It was noted in the breadcrumbs that some tertiary pages were given a place in the secondary navigation
        </li>
        <li class="ff-primary content-margin">- Redesign the online search pages, and reduce the number of blue shades to provide better contrast for UI elements

        </li>
        <li class="ff-primary content-margin">- Ensure all NAA logos link back to the homepage
