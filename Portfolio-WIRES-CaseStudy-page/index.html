                This case study investigated the usability of the WIRES website. The user perspective taken was of someone wishing to report a wildlife rescue or donate to WIRES. User testing was performed and assessed, with issues identified as navigation and readability. The home, about, emergency advice, report a rescue, contact us and donation pages were redesigned and a prototype created.

          WIRES is a well established Wildlife Rescue Service, offering advice and assistance for over 130,000 animals annually. It provides full-time mobile Emergency Response across Greater Sydney, South-East Queensland & Tasmania.
          <p class="body-para |  fs-body ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">However, the current website design is difficult to navigate and has no clear flow through information, with large amounts of text.

          <p class="body-para | padding-block-para fs-body ff-primary fw-regular .padding-block-para">To solve the problem the WIRES website needs the navigation bar redesigned to reduce the number of options. The user needs to be provided with a clear flow through the information, and be able to clearly distinguish the appropriate rescue option required for the situation. Additionally, the website needs the ascetics updated to a more modern design.

  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">Our first step to gain an understanding of the user of the WIRES website was to create a Proto Persona. This helped us to develop a picture of the demographics for who the perceived user of the WIRES website might be, and what problems they might be experiencing in using the website. This was followed by an assessment of the current website. The most likely user flows taken by the user in navigating their way to the report a rescue process, wildlife information, and the donation process were identified. A heuristics assessment was also conducted to identify potential areas for improvement and WCAG colour accessibility testing performed.</p>

  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular  padding-block-para">The huristics assessment was conducted by taking screen shots of the potential user flow and adding lables in miro where we perceived problems.

This plan was then implemented to conduct user testing, and feedback was gained on the interface from the perspective of a real user. Aspects for investigation included: navigation of the website, heuristics, and any pain points the user identified. . These parameters were also assessed against ACA’s competitors as a competitor analysis.</p>

      <h5 class="fw-bold ff-primary  padding-block-para">Methodology:</h5>
      <p class="ff-primary">User testing was conducted to collect qualitative data from 5 participants. The testing was recorded via zoom and notes taken for further data analysis. Participants were provided with 3 tasks to complete and assessed for how quickly they can identify the intuitive signaling, move through the user flow, and ask for their opinion on the aesthetics and design of the website.

<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">After establishing the existing user journey through the website, and Feature Prioritisation, we set about ideating to create the new user flow. The first flow being, how to report an urgent rescue. Secondly, how the user donates to WIRES. Thirdly, how to report a non-urgent rescue, and finally finding information on wildlife affected by bushfires. This process generated our new User Flow and User Flow Chart, with the abbreviated User Flow Chart shown here.</p>

<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">Testing our design allowed us to investigate the effectiveness of our ideation phase and solution. It allowed us to test “can the user now navigate to the Report a Rescue and Bushfire Emergency advice information pages”? And “can the user quickly identify the difference between and engage with the report an urgent rescue and report a rescue user flows.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">User Testing</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To test the effectiveness of our redesign user testing was performed. The key takeaway was the secondary navigation of the information architecture was still too complex. Also, feedback received was that the font in the primary navigation could be a little larger for elderly users, and more differentiation between small, medium and large elements to create a clear hierarchy.</p>

<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">Even though testing showed there were still some problems with our design, we were confident that we were on the right track with our initial wireframes. To improve the prototype some iterations would be required to refine the experience for the user.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Iterations</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">To solve the problems we identified in the user testing we made several iterations to the wireframes. For the information architecture the secondary navigation options were reduced. The information pages were redesigned to break up the content more by adding pictures differing in size and varying their placement.

<h4 class="fw-bold ff-primary fs-500 padding-block-para content-margin">Style Guide and High Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
<p class="ff-primary padding-block-para content-margin">With our wireframes finalised a style guide was created and applied to create the High fidelity wireframes and prototyping completed. Rebranding was not part of this redesign. However, a slight change was made to the primary green and orange to pass WCAG accessibility.

      <h3 class="fs-hero-subheading fw-regular ">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">The redesign of the homepage and information architecture to improve the user flow through to the report a rescue process, make a donation directly to WIRES, and wildlife rescue information was a success. The user could easily navigate to the Wildlife Rescue Information, select what information to read was important to them and identify how to take action. Also, easily identify how to report an urgent or non-urgent rescue and make a decision on the more appropriate action.

  <p class="ff-primary fw-regular padding-block-para">What I learned from the experience was that whilst a website has many pages to present to the user they don’t all need to be presented in the primary navigation. Establishing the core business areas, creating defined user flows from these areas and making these the primary navigation presents the user with clear starting points for finding information. Additionally, breaking up large blocks of copy with images of differing sizes and varying the position creates a hierarchy and boundaries for information. This greatly assists the ability of the user to scan the information and improves readability by not overwhelming the user with content.

        Further redesign was identified as required during the Usability Testing stage of this Case study, but was beyond the capability to be implemented in the timeframe allocated.
        </p>
        <ul class="ff-primary padding-block-400 content-margin">These areas to be addressed in the future include:
        </ul> 
        <li class="ff-primary content-margin">- Improve the promotion of the public involvement opportunities
        </li>
        <li class="ff-primary content-margin">- Restructure the information on and navigation to the training courses and enrolment process
